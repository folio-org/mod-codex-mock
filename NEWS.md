0.1.0 2017-12-01
Uses RMB. Preloads six trivial records into the database at tenant init. These
can be queried with the usual CQL, and sorted etc. Possible to run multiple
instances in the same installation, and they return overlapping subsets of
the records.

## 0.0.1 2017-11-24
Initial raw release, with the bare minimum of functionality. Two hard-coded
records that can be listed, or fetched by their id.
